=================================================
Introduction 
in this lab we mainly focus on design a protocol so that we can obtain Fast, Reliable File transfer. TCP can indeed provide a reliable transmission service, but the speed of the transmission is not that idea comparing with UDP. in order to have both features: Fast and reliable, we designed a protocol that based on UDP data transmission structure (UDP socket structure), and then we added acknowledgements and retransmission features to it.
=================================================
how to compile
1. we need two linux machines and using 1Gbps switch and ethernet cables to connect these two machines.

2. add 200ms delay on both side, and total 20% loss by using the following command
-sudo tc qdisc set dev enps0 root netter delay 200ms loss 10%
or
-sudo tc qdisc change dev enps0 root netter delay 200ms loss 10%

3. ping server and client using following command
on the client side:
-ping 162.198.0.100

one the server side:
-ping 162.198.0.200

(162.198.0.100 and 162.198.0.200 are the static IP address for server and client correspondingly.)

4. after everything is set up, run the server side code first, waiting fo the connection from the client.
----->make all
----->./client
----->./server

5. run the client code, and request the file that you want to send, then the transmission between server and client will begin.

6. when all the file transmission is done, you will see there is a text shows that the file transmission is successful.

=================================================
conclusion
using our protocol, a big file (>= 1GB) can be transmitted successfully with at least speed of 200Mbps
